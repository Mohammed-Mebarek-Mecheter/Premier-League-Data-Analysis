# Premier League Data Analysis Project

This data analysis project focuses on analyzing Premier League match data from the last 5 seasons. The dataset includes match scores, expected goals (xG), attendances, referees, and more. The project is implemented in Python using popular data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Dataset Information

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing data.
- Converting date and time columns to DateTime objects.
- Ensuring appropriate data types for analysis.

### Overall Team Performance

- Analyzing the overall win-loss-draw distribution of teams over the last 5 seasons.

### Seasonal Analysis

- Exploring how the average attendance varied across seasons.
- Identifying the season with the highest number of total goals scored.

### Team Performance
